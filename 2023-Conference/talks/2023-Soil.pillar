! Soil - a fresh look on OO databases

Norbert Hartl (norbert@hartl.name)

""Abstract:""
Soil is a new and light-weight object-oriented database for pharo. It turns a pharo image into a database instance that supports state-of-the-art abilities like ACID-transactions, MVCC and more. It aims to be a small and comprehensible database library that can be adjusted to individual use cases. 
In this talk we will give an introduction to Soil, its usage and how it can be extended. We will also show how pharo might be using Soil for its own data to manage.
