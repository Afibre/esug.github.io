! Releasing on every commit

George Ganea (georgeganea@gmail.com)

""Abstract:"" 
Glamorous Toolkit is developed on trunk and gets released on every commit that leaves the build green. For every release, we tag all Git repositories and publish the modified baselines to ensure reproducibility of the release. This works with a deeply nested structure, which in the case of Glamorous Toolkit consists of 53 different projects. In this talk, we detail the Releaser infrastructure and how it can be used for any other Pharo project.
